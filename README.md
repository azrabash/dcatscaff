Dcat Admin is based on laravel-admin. It allows you to quickly build a fully functional backend system of high value with very little code. Built with a wealth of common back-end components, out of the box, allowing developers to say goodbye to redundant HTML code, very back-end developer-friendly.

This package has been modified scaffolding with auto route, menu and permission to make you more easy to develop your own app.
